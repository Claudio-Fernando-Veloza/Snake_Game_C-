# Snake_Game_C-
Simple Old School Snake Game created on c++
Hello and Welcome to my Snake Game Project ! 

This project was built using C++ . It is designed to mirror the famous snake game that we all know and love from the old Nokia phones . 
It is built to look and feel the same as the old fashioned game . 

I built it using simple loops and tried to keep it as basic and easily-understandable as possible . 

This was one of my first self built projects that i made after completing my studies of the C++ Language . 


Some basic game rules : 

1) The commands are as follows : 

	W- UP , 
	A-LEFT,
	D-RIGHT,
	S-DOWN , 
2) Basic aim of the game : 

	To eat the Fruit (F) as appears in game 
	and try not to eat yourself or hit the edge of the game wall . 

3) Rules : 

	Move however you would like , just avoid the walls and avoid hitting yourself . 
	The more fruit(F) you eat , the larger the snake character becomes .

4) Just enjoy yourself while playing and let the old memories of the game bring a smile to your face ! 


Thank you so much for taking the time to play my Snake Game ! 
Have a great one !
